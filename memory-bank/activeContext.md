## Current Focus

The current focus is on implementing the core MCP server functionality with Dust AI integration. Specifically:

1. Implementing single agent dust query functionality
2. Setting up file upload capabilities for the Dust agent via MCP Client (Claude Desktop)
3. Implementing document processing workflow
4. Developing session state management for preserving context across interactions

## Recent Changes

* Initialized memory bank system
* Implemented basic MCP server structure with TypeScript
* Set up Express.js server with STDIO transport support
* Created file upload, document processing, and Dust agent tools
* Configured environment variables and directory structure
* Generalized MCP tools by removing health-specific components:
  * Renamed tools to more general names (`process_document`, `get_document`, `upload_document`)
  * Updated document types to be more general ("report", "correspondence", "data_analysis", "general")
  * Updated focus areas in insights generation to be more general
  * Updated server name from "health-data-mcp-server" to "dust-mcp-server"
  * Updated README.MD to reflect all changes

## Open Questions/Issues

* Implementation of Dynamic Agent Discovery
* Strategy for parallel and sequential execution with context passing
* Session state management implementation using Dust's conversation.sId
* Caching strategy for agent configurations
* Testing framework setup and test coverage requirements
