  * Renamed `get_health_document` to `get_document`
  * Renamed `upload_health_document` to `upload_document`
  * Updated document types to be more general ("report", "correspondence", "data_analysis", "general")
  * Updated focus areas in `generate_insights` to be more general ("summary", "details", "overview", "trends")
  * Updated server name from "health-data-mcp-server" to "dust-mcp-server"
  * Updated README.MD to reflect all changes

## Current Tasks
