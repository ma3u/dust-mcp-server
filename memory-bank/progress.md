* Develop SDK integration strategy
* Design file upload and processing workflow
* Set up project structure and dependency management
* Implement MCP TypeScript SDK integration
* Create basic Express.js server configuration
* Implement transport handling (STDIO and HTTP/SSE)
* Set up environment configuration and security
* Environment Configuration - Setting up connections to various data sources
* **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
  * Set up GitHub Actions workflow with test matrix (Node.js 18.x/20.x)
  * Integrated security scanning with npm audit and OWASP Dependency-Check
  * Added performance testing using Autocannon
  * Configured code coverage reporting with Codecov
  * Set up build verification and artifact storage
  * Added quality gates for test coverage and security
* Implemented HTTP/SSE mode for MCP server (added /events SSE endpoint, integrated event broadcasting, preserved STDIO fallback)
* Added Smithery build and deployment support (created smithery.yaml with buildCommand/startCommand, fixed config errors)
* Implemented single agent dust query functionality
* Created dustService.ts for direct Dust API interactions (decided against using SDK)
* Implemented agent configuration caching to improve performance

* [2025-05-06 20:30:21] Fixed Jest ESM syntax errors, closed all test blocks, ensured all MCP unit/integration tests pass.
* Improved markdown formatting in memory-bank files
* Documented API integration decisions in decisionLog.md
* Generalized MCP tools by removing health-specific components:
  * Renamed `process_health_document` to `process_document`
  * Renamed `get_health_document` to `get_document`
  * Renamed `upload_health_document` to `upload_document`
  * Updated document types to be more general ("report", "correspondence", "data_analysis", "general")
  * Updated focus areas in `generate_insights` to be more general ("summary", "details", "overview", "trends")
  * Updated server name from "health-data-mcp-server" to "dust-mcp-server"
  * Updated README.MD to reflect all changes
* Added VS Code debugging configuration:
  * Created launch.json with debug configurations for server and tests
  * Added tasks.json for build automation
  * Updated README with debugging instructions
* Implemented test infrastructure:
  * Added Jest configuration with TypeScript support
  * Set up unit and integration test directories
  * Implemented AgentService and DustApiService
  * Added API routes for agent operations
  * Created comprehensive test coverage

## Current Tasks

* [x] [2025-05-15 13:10:26] Implemented a logger with log levels in logs/ directory, strictly following best practices and ensuring MCP STDIO JSON output is never broken. Logging is file-based by default and console logging is disabled for MCP production. Updated systemPatterns.md to use inline markdown links instead of reference numbers for clarity and compliance.
* [x] [2025-05-24] Implement dust queries to multiple agents
  * Added support for querying multiple agents in parallel
  * Implemented result aggregation and deduplication
* [x] [2025-05-24] Implement parallel and sequential execution with context passing
  * Added execution mode configuration (parallel/sequential)
  * Implemented context passing between agent executions
* [x] [2025-05-24] Implement Context-Aware Multi-Agent Routing
  * Added agent capability-based routing
  * Implemented context-aware request distribution
* [ ] Implement session state management
  * Add session persistence
  * Implement session timeout handling
* [ ] Complete file handling in Dust Agent
  * Implement file upload endpoint
  * Add file processing workflow
* [ ] Implement agent filtering by capability tags
  * Add tag-based agent discovery
  * Implement tag-based routing rules



## Next Steps

### High Priority

* [ ] Implement session state management
