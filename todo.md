# MCP Server Development To-Do List

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Planning

- [x] Research Dust.tt agent configuration SDK requirements: [dust-sdk-js](https://github.com/dust-tt/dust-sdk-js)
- [x] Document Claude Desktop MCP client capabilities and limitations.
- [x] Identify required integrations with health data sources.
- [x] List security and privacy requirements for health data.
- [x] Determine performance requirements for real-time agent communication.
- [x] Review the latest MCP specification and compliance requirements.
- [x] Analyze TypeScript SDK capabilities and limitations.
- [x] Evaluate transport options (HTTP/SSE vs stdio) for Claude Desktop.
- [x] Create project roadmap with key milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 2: Architecture and Design

- [x] Design overall MCP server architecture with clear component separation.
- [x] Draft data flow diagrams for health data processing pipeline.
- [x] Define API interfaces between MCP server and Dust agents.
- [x] Design authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [x] Create health data processing pipeline design.
- [x] Develop SDK integration strategy.
- [x] Design file upload and processing workflow.

## Phase 3: Core Implementation

### Milestone 1: Basic MCP Server Setup

- [x] Set up project structure and dependency management.
