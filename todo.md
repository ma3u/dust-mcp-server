# MCP Server Development To-Do List

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Planning

- [x] Research Dust.tt agent configuration SDK requirements: [dust-sdk-js](https://github.com/dust-tt/dust-sdk-js)
- [x] Document Claude Desktop MCP client capabilities and limitations.
- [x] Identify required integrations with health data sources.
- [x] List security and privacy requirements for health data.
- [x] Determine performance requirements for real-time agent communication.
- [x] Review the latest MCP specification and compliance requirements.
- [x] Analyze TypeScript SDK capabilities and limitations.
- [x] Evaluate transport options (HTTP/SSE vs stdio) for Claude Desktop.
- [x] Create project roadmap with key milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 2: Architecture and Design

- [x] Design overall MCP server architecture with clear component separation.
- [x] Draft data flow diagrams for health data processing pipeline.
- [x] Define API interfaces between MCP server and Dust agents.
- [x] Design authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [x] Create health data processing pipeline design.
- [x] Develop SDK integration strategy.
- [x] Design file upload and processing workflow.

## Phase 3: Core Implementation

### Milestone 1: Basic MCP Server Setup

- [x] Set up project structure and dependency management.
- [x] Implement MCP TypeScript SDK integration.
- [x] Create basic Express.js server configuration.
- [x] Implement transport handling (STDIO and HTTP/SSE).
- [x] Set up environment configuration and security.

### Milestone 2: DUST Integration

- [ ] Implement single agent dust query: Enables direct querying of one specific configured Dust agent
- [ ] Implement Dynamic Agent Discovery
- [ ] Implement dust queries to multiple agents: Enables querying of multiple Dust agents, choose the right ones by context and prompt of the user 
- [ ] Implement parallel and Sequential execution with context passing with multiple Dust Agents
- [ ] Consolidate the results, focus on the reduce duplications  
- [ ] User can upload files to the Dust agent via MCP Client (Claude Desktop)
  - [ ] Creates dedicated upload directory
  - [ ] Enforces security policies via environment variables
  - [ ] Implement File Handling in Dust Agent
  - [ ] 

### Milestone 3: Advanced MCP capabilituies

- [X] Environment Configuration - Setting up connections to various data sources 
- [ ] Session State Management - Preserving context across interactions, based on the provided MCP SDK
- [ ] Use Dust's conversation.sId for session tracking
- [ ] Context-Aware Multi-Agent Routing
- [ ] Cache agent configurations (TTL: 5 mins)
- [ ] Implement agent filtering by capability tags

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

### Milestone 1: Unit and Integration Testing
- [ ] Create test framework setup.
- [ ] Develop unit tests for core components.
- [ ] Implement integration tests for APIs.
- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for critical flows.

### Milestone 2: Security Testing
- [ ] Conduct file upload security testing.

### Milestone 3: Documentation

- [ ] Complete API documentation.
- [ ] Create user guides.
- [ ] Develop administrator documentation.
- [ ] Prepare security documentation.

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Test MCP server with Claude Desktop client.

### Performance and Security Testing

- [ ] Conduct load testing with multiple simultaneous users.

This checklist provides a structured approach to track progress across all phases of the project.
