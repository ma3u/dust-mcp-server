# MCP Server Development To-Do List

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Planning
- [ ] Research Dust.tt agent configuration SDK requirements: https://github.com/dust-tt/dust-sdk-js
- [ ] Document Claude Desktop MCP client capabilities and limitations.
- [ ] Identify required integrations with health data sources.
- [ ] List security and privacy requirements for health data.
- [ ] Determine performance requirements for real-time agent communication.
- [ ] Review the latest MCP specification and compliance requirements.
- [ ] Analyze TypeScript SDK capabilities and limitations.
- [ ] Evaluate transport options (HTTP/SSE vs stdio) for Claude Desktop.
- [ ] Create project roadmap with key milestones and deliverables.

## Phase 2: Architecture and Design
- [ ] Design overall MCP server architecture with clear component separation.
- [ ] Draft data flow diagrams for health data processing pipeline.
- [ ] Define API interfaces between MCP server and Dust agents.
- [ ] Design authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [ ] Create error handling and logging strategy.
- [ ] Develop schemas for personal health information storage.
- [ ] Design schemas for blood test results, Apple Health, and Keto Mojo data.

## Phase 3: Implementation
