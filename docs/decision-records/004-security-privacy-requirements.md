# Decision Record: Security and Privacy Requirements for Health Data

## Date
2025-04-09

## Context
Health data is highly sensitive and subject to various privacy regulations. Our MCP server must implement robust security and privacy measures to protect user health information while enabling valuable insights through Dust agents.

## Research Findings

### Regulatory Considerations
- **HIPAA**: While our application may not be a covered entity, following HIPAA-inspired practices is prudent
- **GDPR**: Compliance required for EU users, including data portability and right to be forgotten
- **CCPA/CPRA**: California privacy regulations applicable to health-adjacent applications
- **Health Data Privacy Laws**: Various jurisdictions have specific health data privacy requirements

### Data Security Requirements

#### Authentication and Authorization
- Strong user authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Session management with appropriate timeouts
- API key rotation and management for Dust API access

#### Data Encryption
- Encryption at rest for all stored health data
- Encryption in transit using TLS 1.3+
- Secure key management practices
- Consider field-level encryption for particularly sensitive data

#### Secure Data Storage
- No persistent storage of health data unless explicitly requested by user
- Clear data retention policies and mechanisms
- Secure deletion capabilities
- Data minimization principles (only store what's necessary)

#### Secure Processing
- Memory protection during data processing
- Secure handling of temporary files
- Protection against side-channel attacks
- Sanitization of data before agent processing

### Privacy Requirements

#### User Consent and Control
- Clear consent mechanisms for data collection and processing
- Granular permissions for different data types
- User ability to delete their data
- Transparency about data usage and processing

#### Data Minimization
- Only collect necessary data for the intended purpose
- Implement appropriate anonymization where possible
- Limit data retention periods
- Provide data aggregation options

#### Third-Party Data Sharing
- Clear policies for data shared with Dust agents
- No unauthorized sharing of health data
- Data processing agreements with service providers
- Audit trail of data access and sharing

#### Privacy by Design
- Privacy impact assessments for new features
- Data protection impact assessments
- Privacy-enhancing technologies implementation
- Regular privacy reviews and audits

### Technical Security Measures

#### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security testing and code reviews

#### Infrastructure Security
- Secure deployment environments
- Network security controls
- Regular security patching
- Security monitoring and logging

#### Incident Response
- Security incident response plan
- Data breach notification procedures
- Recovery mechanisms
- Post-incident analysis process

## Decision
Based on the research, we will:

1. Implement end-to-end encryption for health data
2. Design with privacy by default and privacy by design principles
3. Create clear user consent mechanisms for data processing
4. Develop secure data storage with appropriate retention policies
5. Implement comprehensive logging and auditing
6. Follow HIPAA-inspired security practices even if not legally required

## Consequences
- Development will require additional security-focused resources
- User experience must balance security with usability
- Regular security reviews and updates will be necessary
- Documentation must clearly communicate privacy practices
- Additional testing for security vulnerabilities required

## Open Questions
- How will we handle international privacy requirements?
- What's the appropriate balance between local and cloud processing?
- How should we approach data portability requirements?
