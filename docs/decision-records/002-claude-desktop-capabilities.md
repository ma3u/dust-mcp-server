# Decision Record: Claude Desktop MCP Client Capabilities and Limitations

## Date
2025-04-09

## Context
Claude Desktop serves as the primary user interface for interacting with our MCP server. Understanding its capabilities and limitations is essential for designing a compatible and effective MCP server implementation.

## Research Findings

### Transport Mechanisms
- **STDIO Transport**: Claude Desktop primarily uses STDIO for initial connections
  - Provides a reliable communication channel for command-line based interactions
  - Limited to synchronous request-response patterns
  - Cannot support real-time updates without polling
  
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events) Transport**: Supported for real-time updates
  - Enables streaming responses from agents
  - Allows for asynchronous notifications
  - Better user experience for long-running operations

### MCP Protocol Support
- Supports the current MCP specification (2024-11-05)
- Also compatible with the latest specification (2025-03-26)
- Implements standard MCP handshake protocol
- Supports tool calling with structured inputs and outputs

### UI Capabilities
- Renders markdown-formatted responses
- Supports rich text formatting
- Can display images and other media content
- Provides interactive elements for tool inputs
- Maintains conversation history within the session

### Performance Considerations
- Limited by local system resources
- May experience latency with large response payloads
- Streaming responses improve perceived performance
- Connection timeouts may occur with long-running operations

### Security Aspects
- Local execution environment
- No built-in authentication beyond system-level controls
- Relies on the MCP server for data privacy enforcement
- Sensitive data should not be logged to console

### Limitations
- No built-in file upload UI (relies on file path inputs)
- Limited support for complex interactive elements
- Cannot maintain persistent connections across restarts
- No native support for background processing
- Console logging breaks STDIO transport communication

## Decision
Based on the research, we will:

1. Implement dual transport support (STDIO and SSE) in our MCP server
2. Design for graceful degradation when streaming is not available
3. Avoid console.log() in favor of proper logging mechanisms
4. Implement timeout handling for long-running operations
5. Use markdown formatting for optimal response rendering
6. Support both current and latest MCP specifications

## Consequences
- The MCP server must handle both transport mechanisms appropriately
- We need to implement proper error handling for connection issues
- Response formatting should leverage markdown capabilities
- Logging must not interfere with STDIO transport
- Long-running operations should provide progress updates

## Open Questions
- How should we handle reconnection scenarios?
- What's the optimal timeout configuration for health data processing?
- How can we improve the file upload experience given the UI limitations?
