# Authentication and Authorization Implementation

## Decision

We have implemented a comprehensive authentication and authorization system for the MCP server with the following components:

1. API Key Authentication: For securing API endpoints
2. JWT Authentication: For web access authentication
3. Session Management: For tracking user sessions
4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): For permission management
5. Resource-Based Permissions: For fine-grained access control

## Context

The MCP server needs to secure access to its resources and ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive health data. We need multiple authentication mechanisms to support different client types and use cases.

## Considerations

- Security: The system must protect sensitive health data
- Flexibility: Support multiple authentication methods
- Performance: Authentication should add minimal overhead
- Maintainability: The code should be modular and easy to update

## Implementation Details

### API Key Authentication

- Simple header-based authentication using the `X-API-Key` header
- Configured via environment variables
- Suitable for server-to-server communication

### JWT Authentication

- Token-based authentication using the `Authorization` header with Bearer scheme
- Supports user roles and expiration
- Suitable for web applications and mobile clients

### Session Management

- In-memory session store with TTL-based expiration
- Supports session data storage and retrieval
- Designed to be replaceable with Redis for production environments

### Role-Based Access Control

- Predefined roles: admin, user, guest
- Each role has a set of permissions
- Hierarchical permission structure

### Resource-Based Permissions

- Fine-grained permissions on specific resources
- Support for resource ownership checks
- Middleware for enforcing permissions in Express routes

## Alternatives Considered

1. OAuth 2.0: More complex but provides more features
2. Database-backed session storage: More persistent but adds complexity
3. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): More flexible but more complex

## Consequences

### Positive

- Modular authentication system that can be extended
- Multiple authentication methods for different use cases
- Fine-grained permission control
- Development mode bypasses for easier testing

### Negative

- In-memory session storage is not suitable for production without Redis
- Role definitions are currently hardcoded and not configurable
- No built-in rate limiting for authentication attempts

## Future Work

- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Implement OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations
- Move role definitions to a configuration file or database
- Add audit logging for authentication and authorization events
