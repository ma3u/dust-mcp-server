## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| SDK version incompatibility | Medium | High | Regular dependency updates, compatibility testing |
| Document processing accuracy issues | High | Medium | Implement robust validation, manual review option |
| Performance bottlenecks | Medium | High | Early performance testing, scalable architecture |
| Security vulnerabilities | Medium | Critical | Security-first design, regular audits |
| Dust API limitations | Medium | Medium | Design for API constraints, implement fallbacks |
| Regulatory compliance issues | Low | Critical | Privacy by design, HIPAA/GDPR compliance |

### Contingency Plans

1. **SDK Issues**
   - Maintain compatibility layer
   - Prepare for quick updates
   - Document workarounds

2. **Document Processing**
   - Implement confidence scores
   - Allow manual corrections
   - Support multiple processing engines

3. **Performance**
   - Design for horizontal scaling
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize critical paths

4. **Security**
   - Regular security reviews
   - Implement defense in depth
   - Create incident response plan

## Decision

Based on the revised project roadmap, we will:

1. Complete the architecture and design phase with the updated approach
2. Proceed with core implementation using existing SDKs
3. Implement file upload and processing for health documents
4. Develop MCP tools for document processing and agent interaction
5. Follow the defined timeline and resource allocation
6. Implement the risk management strategies

## Consequences

- The revised roadmap provides a clear path forward
- Using existing SDKs will accelerate development
- File upload approach simplifies initial implementation
- The phased approach allows for incremental delivery
- Risk management strategies address potential issues

## Open Questions

- How will we handle future SDK updates?
- What's the optimal approach for scaling document processing?
- How should we prioritize MCP tool implementation?
