# Decision Record: Transport Options Evaluation for Claude Desktop

## Date
2025-04-09

## Context
Claude Desktop supports multiple transport mechanisms for communicating with MCP servers. Evaluating these options is crucial for designing an efficient and reliable communication layer in our implementation.

## Research Findings

### Available Transport Options

#### STDIO Transport
- **Description**: Standard input/output-based communication
- **Protocol**: Line-delimited JSON messages
- **Implementation**: `StdioServerTransport` in MCP TypeScript SDK
- **Use Case**: Primary transport for command-line based interactions

##### Advantages
- Simple implementation with minimal dependencies
- Direct process-to-process communication
- Low latency for basic interactions
- Native support in Claude Desktop
- Works well for synchronous request-response patterns

##### Limitations
- Cannot support real-time updates without polling
- Limited to single-process communication
- No built-in reconnection capabilities
- Breaks when using console.log() for debugging
- Challenging to scale for multiple concurrent sessions

#### HTTP/SSE Transport
- **Description**: HTTP-based communication with Server-Sent Events for streaming
- **Protocol**: RESTful API with SSE for asynchronous responses
- **Implementation**: `HttpServerTransport` in MCP TypeScript SDK
- **Use Case**: Web-based interactions and streaming responses

##### Advantages
- Supports real-time streaming responses
- Enables asynchronous notifications
- Better scalability for multiple concurrent sessions
- More robust connection management
- Standard web protocol with broad tooling support

##### Limitations
- More complex implementation
- Requires proper HTTP server setup
- Additional network configuration (ports, firewalls)
- Potential cross-origin considerations
- Slightly higher latency for initial connection

### Implementation Considerations

#### Dual Transport Support
- Both transports can be implemented simultaneously
- Transport selection based on client capabilities
- Graceful degradation when streaming is not available
- Consistent message handling across transports

#### STDIO Implementation Details
- Process management considerations
- Signal handling for clean shutdown
- Buffer management to prevent overflow
- Error propagation through exit codes
- Avoiding console.log() which breaks the transport

#### HTTP/SSE Implementation Details
- Server configuration (port, host, TLS)
- Connection timeout handling
- Keep-alive mechanisms
- CORS configuration if needed
- Authentication and security considerations

### Performance Implications

#### Latency Comparison
- STDIO: Lower initial latency (~10-50ms)
- HTTP/SSE: Slightly higher initial latency (~50-200ms)
- STDIO: Higher latency for long-running operations
- HTTP/SSE: Better performance for streaming responses

#### Throughput Considerations
- STDIO: Limited by process I/O capabilities
- HTTP/SSE: Better throughput for concurrent operations
- STDIO: Potential bottlenecks with large payloads
- HTTP/SSE: More efficient for large data transfers

#### Resource Utilization
- STDIO: Lower memory footprint
- HTTP/SSE: Higher memory usage but better scalability
- STDIO: Limited by single-process constraints
- HTTP/SSE: Can leverage multi-core processing

### Claude Desktop Compatibility

#### Current Support
- Claude Desktop fully supports STDIO transport
- HTTP/SSE support is available for streaming responses
- Transport negotiation during handshake
- Fallback mechanisms for compatibility

#### Future Considerations
- Trend toward HTTP/SSE for advanced features
- Continued support for STDIO for backward compatibility
- Potential for WebSocket support in future versions
- Evolution of transport security requirements

## Decision
Based on the research, we will:

1. Implement dual transport support with STDIO as the primary transport
2. Add HTTP/SSE transport for streaming responses and real-time updates
3. Design a transport-agnostic message handling layer
4. Implement proper error handling for both transport mechanisms
5. Avoid console.log() in favor of proper logging mechanisms
6. Configure appropriate timeouts and reconnection strategies

## Consequences
- The MCP server will be compatible with various Claude Desktop configurations
- We need to implement and test both transport mechanisms thoroughly
- Logging must be implemented without breaking STDIO transport
- The architecture must handle transport-specific error scenarios
- Documentation should include transport configuration guidance

## Open Questions
- What's the optimal configuration for HTTP/SSE in production environments?
- How should we handle transport failover scenarios?
- What metrics should we collect to monitor transport performance?
