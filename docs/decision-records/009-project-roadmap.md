**Total Duration**: 10 weeks (approximately 2.5 months)

## Resource Allocation

### Development Team
- 1 Lead Developer: Architecture, core implementation, code review
- 2 Full-stack Developers: Implementation, testing, documentation
- 1 Security Specialist: Security review, privacy implementation (part-time)
- 1 QA Engineer: Testing, quality assurance (part-time)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Development environment: Local machines with Node.js
- Testing environment: Staging server with Dust API access
- Production environment: Cloud-based deployment

### External Dependencies
- Dust API access and credentials
- Claude Desktop for testing
- Test health data samples
- Security assessment tools

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Dust API Changes**: Changes to the Dust API could impact integration
2. **MCP Specification Updates**: New MCP versions could require adaptation
3. **Performance Challenges**: Health data processing may face performance issues
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Health data sensitivity requires robust security
5. **Integration Complexity**: Multiple system integration may increase complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Regular monitoring of Dust API changes and versioned dependencies
2. Flexible architecture to accommodate MCP specification updates
3. Early performance testing and optimization
4. Regular security reviews and privacy-by-design approach
5. Modular architecture with clear interface definitions

## Decision
Based on the roadmap planning, we will:

1. Follow the 10-week timeline with defined milestones and deliverables
2. Allocate resources according to the outlined requirements
3. Implement the risk management strategies
4. Review progress weekly and adjust the roadmap as needed
5. Prioritize core functionality first, followed by advanced features

## Consequences
- The project has a clear timeline and deliverables for tracking
- Resource allocation is defined for proper staffing
- Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
- The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing
- Regular reviews will be necessary to maintain the timeline

## Open Questions
- How should we handle scope changes during development?
- What's the contingency plan for significant delays?
- How will we prioritize features if time constraints arise?
