# Decision Record: MCP Specification and Compliance Requirements

## Date
2025-04-09

## Context
Our MCP server must comply with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification to ensure proper communication with Claude Desktop. This document reviews the latest MCP specification and outlines compliance requirements for our implementation.

## Research Findings

### MCP Specification Overview

#### Current Specification (2024-11-05)
- Defines standard communication protocol between AI clients and tool servers
- Specifies handshake protocol and message formats
- Outlines tool definition and invocation patterns
- Includes error handling and status reporting mechanisms

#### Latest Specification (2025-03-26)
- Extends the current specification with additional features
- Improves streaming response handling
- Enhances error reporting capabilities
- Adds support for more complex data structures
- Includes better session management capabilities

### Core Protocol Components

#### Handshake Protocol
- Initial connection establishment
- Version negotiation
- Capability discovery
- Authentication (when required)
- Session establishment

#### Message Format
- JSON-based message structure
- Defined schema for requests and responses
- Support for binary data through base64 encoding
- Structured error responses

#### Tool Definition
- Schema-based tool definitions using JSON Schema
- Parameter validation rules
- Tool description and documentation
- Tool categorization and grouping

#### Tool Invocation
- Request format for tool calls
- Response structure requirements
- Streaming response protocol
- Error handling during invocation

### Transport Requirements

#### STDIO Transport
- Line-delimited JSON messages
- Synchronous request-response pattern
- No external dependencies
- Limited to single-process communication

#### HTTP/SSE Transport
- RESTful API endpoints
- Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
- Cross-origin considerations
- Authentication and security requirements

### Compliance Requirements

#### Protocol Conformance
- Strict adherence to message formats
- Proper implementation of handshake protocol
- Correct tool definition format
- Valid response structures

#### Error Handling
- Standard error codes and messages
- Proper error propagation
- Detailed error information for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

#### Security Considerations
- Secure transport implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Proper handling of sensitive information

#### Performance Requirements
- Responsive handshake process
- Efficient message processing
- Timely response generation
- Proper resource management

### TypeScript SDK Capabilities

#### Core Functionality
- Implements MCP protocol specification
- Provides type-safe interfaces for tool definitions
- Handles message serialization and deserialization
- Manages transport connections

#### Transport Support
- Built-in STDIO transport implementation
- HTTP/SSE transport capabilities
- Extensible transport interface
- Connection management utilities

#### Tool Management
- Simplified tool registration
- Parameter validation using Zod
- Type-safe tool invocation
- Error handling utilities

#### Limitations
- Limited built-in security features
- Basic session management
- Minimal monitoring capabilities
- Limited documentation for advanced scenarios

## Decision
Based on the research, we will:

1. Use the official TypeScript SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk) for core protocol implementation
2. Support both current (2024-11-05) and latest (2025-03-26) MCP specifications
3. Implement dual transport support (STDIO and HTTP/SSE)
4. Create a comprehensive error handling system
5. Develop proper session management capabilities
6. Implement strict parameter validation using Zod

## Consequences
- The MCP server will be compatible with Claude Desktop
- We need to carefully implement both transport mechanisms
- Error handling must follow the MCP specification
- We should leverage Zod for robust parameter validation
- The architecture must support future specification updates

## Open Questions
- How should we handle version differences between specifications?
- What's the best approach for extending the SDK's capabilities?
- How can we ensure backward compatibility as the specification evolves?
