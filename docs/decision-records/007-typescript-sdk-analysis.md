# Decision Record: TypeScript SDK Capabilities and Limitations

## Date
2025-04-09

## Context
The TypeScript SDK for MCP is a critical component of our implementation. Understanding its capabilities and limitations will help us design a robust architecture that leverages its strengths while addressing any gaps.

## Research Findings

### SDK Overview
- **Package**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **Current Version**: 1.1.0 (as of April 2025)
- **License**: MIT
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript definitions

### Core Capabilities

#### Server Implementation
- `McpServer` class for creating MCP-compliant servers
- Simplified tool registration with type safety
- Built-in parameter validation using Zod
- Support for both synchronous and streaming responses
- Error handling utilities with standard error types

#### Transport Layer
- `StdioServerTransport` for command-line communication
- `HttpServerTransport` for HTTP/SSE communication
- Transport abstraction for custom implementations
- Connection management utilities

#### Tool Definition
- Type-safe tool registration
- JSON Schema generation from Zod schemas
- Support for complex parameter types
- Tool categorization and grouping

#### Response Formatting
- Structured response generation
- Support for text, markdown, and other content types
- Streaming response utilities
- Error response formatting

### Advanced Features

#### Session Management
- Basic session tracking capabilities
- Session context storage
- Session timeout handling
- Limited persistence options

#### Authentication
- Basic authentication framework
- Token validation utilities
- Authorization primitives
- Limited built-in security features

#### Logging and Monitoring
- Simple logging interface
- Basic performance metrics
- Limited observability features
- Minimal debugging utilities

### Limitations

#### Security Features
- Limited built-in security mechanisms
- Basic input validation (relies on Zod)
- No built-in rate limiting
- Minimal protection against common vulnerabilities

#### Scalability
- Limited built-in clustering support
- Basic connection pooling
- No built-in load balancing
- Limited resource management

#### Error Handling
- Basic error types and codes
- Limited retry mechanisms
- Minimal circuit breaking capabilities
- Basic timeout handling

#### Documentation
- Limited examples for advanced scenarios
- Sparse documentation for customization
- Few best practices guidelines
- Limited troubleshooting information

### Integration Considerations

#### Dust API Integration
- No built-in Dust API client
- Need for custom integration layer
- Potential compatibility challenges
- Authentication flow management

#### Health Data Processing
- No specific utilities for data processing
- Need for custom parsing implementations
- Limited file handling capabilities
- No built-in validation for health data

#### Performance Optimization
- Limited built-in caching mechanisms
- Basic connection pooling
- Minimal resource optimization
- Limited concurrency control

## Decision
Based on the research, we will:

1. Use the TypeScript SDK as the foundation for our MCP server
2. Extend the SDK with custom security features
3. Implement a robust error handling system beyond the basic capabilities
4. Develop custom integration layers for Dust API
5. Create specialized data processing utilities for health information
6. Implement advanced session management and persistence

## Consequences
- We'll need to develop several custom components to address SDK limitations
- Security features must be implemented with careful consideration
- Performance optimization will require additional engineering
- Documentation should include SDK extension patterns
- Testing must cover both SDK functionality and custom extensions

## Open Questions
- What's the best approach for extending the SDK's error handling?
- How should we implement advanced security features?
- What patterns should we use for custom transport extensions?
