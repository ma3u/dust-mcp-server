## Decision
Based on the research, we will:

1. Implement streaming responses using SSE for real-time communication
2. Design an asynchronous processing architecture for health data
3. Develop a connection pooling mechanism for Dust API requests
4. Implement comprehensive error handling with automatic recovery
5. Create a monitoring system for performance metrics
6. Optimize memory usage with stream processing for large files

## Consequences
- The architecture must prioritize asynchronous operations
- We need to implement proper resource management
- Performance testing will be a critical part of the development process
- Monitoring and observability systems are required
- The system should scale horizontally for higher concurrency needs

## Open Questions
- What's the optimal balance between response time and throughput?
- How should we handle degraded performance scenarios?
- What metrics should we track to ensure performance requirements are met?
