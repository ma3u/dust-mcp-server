# MCP Server Development Project Plan for Dust Health Agent Integration

This project plan outlines the development of a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects Claude Desktop with Dust AI agents, focusing on health data management and personalized health recommendations.

Before diving into the project plan, here's a summary of key findings: A properly structured MCP server can bridge Claude Desktop with Dust's specialized health agents, allowing secure management of personal health data, custom agent conversations, and integration with third-party health devices and services. This MCP server will be built using the TypeScript SDK, supporting both HTTP/SSE and stdio transports, with a focus on usability and data privacy.

## Project Overview and Objectives

### Project Goals
- Create an MCP server that connects Claude Desktop as user interface with multiple Dust AI agents
- Enable configuration and management of multiple health-focused agents
- Provide tools to collect, analyze, and interpret personal health data
- Support uploading and processing of health data from various sources
- Maintain user privacy and data security throughout the system

### Key Stakeholders
- End users: Individuals seeking health insights and recommendations
- Developers: Team building the MCP server implementation
- Dust.tt: Platform hosting the AI agents
- Anthropic: Provider of Claude Desktop client

### Success Criteria
- Claude Desktop successfully connects to the MCP server
- MCP server configure a list of Dust agents (id or name)
- Users interact with multiple Dust health agents
- Health data uploads function correctly from various sources (blood test, apple health, keto mojo as PDF, Image)
- Personalized health prompts generate relevant insights
- Remember older conversations and provide context
- System maintains responsive performance and data privacy
- MCP Server implementation is compliant with the latest MCP specification

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Planning

### 1.1 Technical Requirements Gathering
- Research Dust.tt agent configuration API requirements
- Document Claude Desktop MCP client capabilities and limitations
- Identify required integrations with health data sources
- List security and privacy requirements for health data
- Determine performance requirements for real-time agent communication

### 1.2 MCP Protocol Analysis
- Review the latest MCP specification and compliance requirements
- Analyze TypeScript SDK capabilities and limitations
- Evaluate transport options (HTTP/SSE vs stdio) for Claude Desktop
- Document required MCP tools and resources for implementation
- Identify potential compatibility issues between Dust API and MCP protocol


## Phase 2: Architecture and Design
